# Real-Time Graph Application

This project is a web application that retrieves data from a database and displays it in real-time as a graph. It utilizes modern web technologies including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with libraries such as Chart.js or D3.js for rendering the graph.

## Project Structure

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd realtime-graph-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   You can use a local server to serve the `index.html` file. For example, you can use the `http-server` package:
   ```bash
   npx http-server src
   ```

4. **Open your browser:**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:8080` (or the port specified by your server) to view the application.

## Usage

The application will automatically fetch data from the database and update the graph in real-time. Ensure that your database is set up correctly and that the API endpoints are configured in `src/api/data.js`.
